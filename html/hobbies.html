				<h2>Pool</h2>
				<p>Started playing pool a few years back. Favorite game 9 ball, a game where you shoot the pool balls in order from 1 to 9.</p>
				<h2>Multiplayer video games</h2>
				<p>Been playing video games since I was a wee lad. As I got older I stopped playing them as much and mostly just play a few multiplayer games with 
				friends when we all get a chance to.</p>
				<h2>Hiking</h2>
				<p>I live in the middle of no where and close to an entrence of west rock so in the summer/spring I go for hikes with friends.</p>
				<h2>Coding</h2>
				<p>Since I was a big fan of video games when i was younger i started looking into how to make them. After a time learning to make games turned
				into wanting to learn how to code programs. Now coding is a hobby of mine that I find enjoyable.</p>
				<h2>RPG table top games</h2>
				<p>Games such as Pathfinder and Dungeons and Dragons. Each person gets a character and you go and smash things with friends, but with dice.</p>
